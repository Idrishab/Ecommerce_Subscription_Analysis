# Ecommerce_Subscription_Analysis
This is a Data Analyst project that is primarily executed through SQL statements in order to fulfill the business request below.

Business Request/Scenario
As a new eCommerce business who have just been through the first month, we are interested in concise information on how our subscription has been over this first month.
We are interested in knowing how many subscriptions each registered customer has ordered for throughout last month.
It is equally important to know the total amount each customer has spent placing orders on our subscriptions.
Keep in mind that we will like to recognize each customer only by their names and customer id. All customers who ordered for subscription(s) have been recorded in the orders table.
We have collected and stored the needed information in three tables namely orders, customers, and subscriptions.
